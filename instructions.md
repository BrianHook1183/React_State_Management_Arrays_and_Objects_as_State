# Instructions
Create an app that has a button and will display a list of times that the button was pressed.

You should complete the App component in App.jsx and the ClickTimes component in ClickTimes.jsx.

Use the TimestampsDisplay to display the results.

## Tips
- The App component should be the parent component of ClickTimes and TimestampsDisplay.
- You do not need to edit TimestampsDisplay.
- The App.jsx file currently has a demo of how to use the TimestampsDisplay. You can delete this code.
- You can get the current timestamp with Date.now().
